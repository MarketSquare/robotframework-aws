# robotframework-aws

AWSLibrary is a testing library for Robot Framework that gives you the ability to use many of the AWS services in your tests. This library directly interacts with [Boto 3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).  Boto is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It enables Python developers to create, configure, and manage AWS services, such as EC2 and S3.

If there is functionality that should be included in this library please create an issue or feel free to contribute.

```

#### 2. Import Package

Pass in your AWS Credentials as parameters as shown below

```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library  AWSLibrary
```

#### 3. Creating a Test Case

When creating a test case, start with creating a session in AWS for your test

```robotframework
***Test Case***
Example Test Case
    Create Session  us-east-1
    Key Should Not Exist  bucky  static/test.html  test.html
    Upload File  bucky  static/test.html  test.html
    Key Should Exist  bucky static/test.html  test.html
    Delete Session  us-east-1
```

## Session

> A session is created to use AWS services as a user defining the region and profile is optional

- | `Create Session With Keys` | region | access_key | secret_key |
- | `Create Session With Profile` | region | profile |
- | `Delete Session` | region | profile=optional |
- | `Delete All Sessions` |

## S3

> A key represents the path of the file located in the S3 bucket and Object Path represents the local path of the file on your host

- | `List Objects` | bucket_name | prefix |
- | `Delete File` | bucket | key |
- | `Upload File` | bucket_name | object_path | key |
- | `Download File` | bucket_name | object_path | key |
- | `Key Should Exist` | bucket_name | object_path | key |
- | `Key Should Not Exist` | bucket_name | object_path | key |
- | `Allowed Methods` | array of methods |

## Resources

> Keywords can be used for local functionality that can be used with all services. These are helper methods to validate functionality, existence, and so on

- | `Local File Should Exist` | path |
- | `Local File Should Not Exist` | path |
